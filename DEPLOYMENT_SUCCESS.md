# BingeTV - Deployment Success! ✅

## Date: October 8, 2025
## Status: 🚀 SITE IS LIVE AND WORKING!

---

## 🎉 **PROBLEM SOLVED!**

### The Issue:
- Subdirectory `.htaccess` files (public/.htaccess, user/.htaccess, admin/.htaccess) were causing 500 errors
- These files had `Require all granted` and `AllowOverride All` directives that conflicted with server config

### The Solution:
- ✅ Removed all subdirectory .htaccess files
- ✅ Kept ONLY root .htaccess for URL routing
- ✅ Set proper permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)
- ✅ Synced all files to correct folder: `/home1/fieldte5/bingetv.co.ke/`
- ✅ Removed confusing backup folders

---
