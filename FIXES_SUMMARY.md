# BingeTV Fixes Summary - October 8, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Broken Subscription Link (404 Error)
**Problem:** User reported getting 404 error on: `https://bingetv.co.ke/user/dashboard/subscriptions/subscribe.php`

**Root Cause:** The file is actually located at `/user/subscriptions/subscribe.php`, but links in `/user/dashboard/index.php` were using relative paths like `subscriptions/subscribe.php`, which resolved to `/user/dashboard/subscriptions/subscribe.php` (incorrect path).

**Fix:**
- Updated all subscription links in `user/dashboard/index.php` to use `../subscriptions/subscribe.php`
- Updated subscription redirects in `user/channels.php` to use absolute path `/user/subscriptions/subscribe.php`

**Files Modified:**
- `user/dashboard/index.php` - Fixed 4 instances of subscription links
- `user/channels.php` - Fixed 2 instances of subscription redirects

---

### 2. ✅ Manual M-Pesa Confirmation System
**Problem:** User requested a manual fallback system for when automatic M-Pesa STK push fails. Users should be able to paste their M-Pesa confirmation message and admin can approve it manually.

**Solution:** Implemented complete manual M-Pesa confirmation workflow:

#### User Side:
1. **Payment Process Page** (`user/payments/process.php`):
   - Already has button: "Already Paid? Submit M-PESA Confirmation"
   - Links to new manual submission page

2. **Manual Submission Page** (`user/payments/submit-mpesa.php`) - **NEW FILE**:
   - Form to paste full M-Pesa SMS message
   - Auto-extracts M-Pesa code and amount from message
   - Stores submission in database for admin review
   - User-friendly instructions

#### Admin Side:
3. **Admin Review Page** (`admin/manual-payments.php`) - **NEW FILE**:
   - Lists all pending manual M-Pesa submissions
   - Shows user details, package, amount, M-Pesa message
   - Admin can approve or reject with notes
   - Approval automatically:
     - Marks payment as completed
     - Creates/activates subscription
     - Updates submission status

4. **Admin Navigation** (`admin/includes/header.php`):
   - Added "Manual M-Pesa" link in Financial section

#### Database:
5. **Migration File** (`database/migrations/010_manual_mpesa_confirmations.sql`):
   - Creates `manual_payment_submissions` table
   - Adds tracking columns to `payments` table
   - Includes proper indexes for performance

6. **Migration Runner** (`run_migration_010.php`):
   - Web-accessible script to run the migration
   - Provides verification and detailed output

**Files Created:**
- `user/payments/submit-mpesa.php` (NEW)
- `admin/manual-payments.php` (NEW)
- `database/migrations/010_manual_mpesa_confirmations.sql` (NEW)
- `run_migration_010.php` (NEW)

**Files Modified:**
- `admin/includes/header.php` (Added navigation link)
- `user/payments/process.php` (Already had the manual M-Pesa link)

---

### 3. ✅ Navigation Links Verification

All user portal navigation links have been verified and use correct paths:

**User Portal Header** (`user/includes/header.php`):
- ✅ Dashboard → `/user/dashboard/`
- ✅ Channels → `/user/channels.php`
- ✅ Gallery → `/user/gallery.php`
- ✅ Subscriptions → `/user/subscriptions/subscribe.php`
- ✅ Payments → `/user/payments/process.php`
- ✅ Support → `/user/support.php`
- ✅ Logout → `/user/logout.php`

All links use absolute paths to avoid relative path issues.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

**New Table: `manual_payment_submissions`**
```sql
- id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- user_id (FK to users)
- payment_id (FK to payments)
- package_id (FK to packages)
- amount (DECIMAL)
- mpesa_code (VARCHAR)
- mpesa_message (TEXT)
- phone_number (VARCHAR)
- submitted_at (TIMESTAMP)
- status (pending/approved/rejected/duplicate)
- admin_id (FK to admin_users)
- admin_notes (TEXT)
- reviewed_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

**Modified Table: `payments`**
- Added `is_manual_confirmation` (BOOLEAN)
- Added `manual_submission_id` (FK to manual_payment_submissions)

### Pricing Logic (Already Implemented)

The pricing model is correctly implemented in both frontend and backend:

- **Monthly (1-5 months):** 
  - Base: KSh 2,500/month
  - Extra devices: KSh 2,000/device
  - Max: 3 devices

- **6-Month Package:**
  - Base: KSh 2,000/month
  - Extra devices: KSh 2,000/device
  - Max: 3 devices

- **Annual (12+ months):**
  - Base: KSh 1,800/month
  - Max: 1 device (no extra devices)

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **SSH Key Verification Failed**: Cannot use automated `rsync` deployment. Manual upload via cPanel required.

2. **Admin Users Table**: The `manual_payment_submissions` table references `admin_users` table. Ensure this table exists or migration will fail.

3. **M-Pesa Till Number**: In `user/payments/submit-mpesa.php`, the Till Number is shown as `XXXXX`. Replace with actual Till Number.

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Delete Migration Runner**: After running `run_migration_010.php`, DELETE it immediately.

2. **Admin Authentication**: Manual payment review requires admin login. Ensure admin authentication is secure.

3. **M-Pesa Code Validation**: Currently, no validation of M-Pesa codes. Admin must manually verify authenticity.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting to manual submission form to prevent spam.

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Restore Original Files**: Replace modified files with backups.

2. **Rollback Database**: Run this SQL:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS manual_payment_submissions;
   ALTER TABLE payments DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS is_manual_confirmation;
   ALTER TABLE payments DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS manual_submission_id;
   ```

---

## Next Steps

1. Upload all files to remote server via cPanel File Manager
2. Run database migration
3. Test all pages according to checklist
4. Monitor error logs for any issues
5. Test manual M-Pesa submission flow end-to-end
6. Replace placeholder Till Number with actual number
