# Manual M-Pesa Payment Confirmation System ✅

## Implemented & Deployed!

---

## 🎯 **What This System Does:**

Since M-Pesa API integration isn't ready yet, users can:
1. Pay manually via M-Pesa to your Till Number
2. Submit their M-Pesa confirmation message
3. Admin reviews and approves
4. Subscription activates automatically upon approval

**This works exactly like automatic M-Pesa, but with manual admin verification!**

---

## 👤 **USER SIDE:**

### How Users Submit Payment:

1. **User subscribes to a package**
2. **Payment page shows TWO options:**
   - "Pay with M-Pesa (Automatic)" ← Will work when API is ready
   - "Already Paid? Submit M-Pesa Confirmation" ← **NEW! Works now!**

3. **User clicks "Submit M-Pesa Confirmation"**
4. **Form appears:**
   - Paste entire M-Pesa SMS message
   - M-Pesa transaction code (auto-extracted)
