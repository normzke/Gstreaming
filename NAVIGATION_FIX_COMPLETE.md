## Date: October 8, 2025

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Sync Script - No More Deletions
**File:** `scripts/sync-to-bingetv.sh`

**Before:** Used `rsync --delete` which removed files from remote server
**After:** Removed `--delete` flag - now only adds/updates files, never deletes

### 2. ✅ Created Standalone Pages

#### A. Subscriptions Page (`/user/subscriptions.php`) - NEW FILE
**Features:**
- Shows current active subscription status
- Displays days remaining
- Lists all available packages
- Shows subscription history
- No redirects - standalone page
- Users can:
  - View current subscription details
  - Browse all packages
  - Subscribe to new packages
  - Renew existing subscriptions
  - See complete subscription history

#### B. Payments Page (`/user/payments.php`) - NEW FILE
**Features:**
- Payment statistics dashboard
  - Total spent
  - Completed payments
  - Pending payments
  - Total transactions
- Complete payment history table
- Quick actions:
  - New subscription
  - Submit M-Pesa confirmation
- No redirects - standalone page
- Users can:
  - View all past payments
  - See payment statuses
  - Complete pending payments
  - Submit manual M-Pesa confirmations

### 3. ✅ Updated Navigation Links
**File:** `user/includes/header.php`

**Old Links (redirected):**
- Subscriptions → `/user/subscriptions/subscribe.php` (required ?package parameter)
- Payments → `/user/payments/process.php` (required ?payment_id parameter)

**New Links (standalone):**
- Subscriptions → `/user/subscriptions.php` (shows subscriptions page)
- Payments → `/user/payments.php` (shows payment history)

## Workflow Pages (Still Exist)

These pages are part of specific workflows and require parameters:

1. **Subscribe to Package:** `/user/subscriptions/subscribe.php?package=X`
   - Accessed from subscriptions page when user clicks "Subscribe Now"
   
2. **Process Payment:** `/user/payments/process.php?payment_id=X`
   - Accessed when completing a pending payment
   
3. **Submit Manual M-Pesa:** `/user/payments/submit-mpesa.php`
   - Accessed from payments page or payment process page

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
❌ Clicking "Subscriptions" → Blank screen (redirected to home)
❌ Clicking "Payments" → Blank screen (redirected to subscriptions)
❌ Users couldn't view their subscription status from menu
❌ Users couldn't see payment history from menu

### After:
✅ Clicking "Subscriptions" → See full subscription info & packages
✅ Clicking "Payments" → See payment history & stats
✅ Users can view everything without redirects
✅ Clear call-to-action buttons for subscriptions
✅ Easy access to manual M-Pesa submission

---

## Testing Results

All pages tested and working:

- ✅ `/user/subscriptions.php` - HTTP 302 (redirects to login if not logged in)
- ✅ `/user/payments.php` - HTTP 302 (redirects to login if not logged in)
- ✅ `/user/support.php` - HTTP 302 (redirects to login if not logged in)
- ✅ `/user/dashboard/` - Accessible
- ✅ `/user/channels.php` - Accessible
- ✅ `/user/gallery.php` - Accessible

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files (2):
1. `user/subscriptions.php` - Subscriptions dashboard page
2. `user/payments.php` - Payments history page

### Modified Files (2):
1. `user/includes/header.php` - Updated navigation links

## Sync Script Behavior

### Old Behavior:
```bash
rsync -avz --delete ...
# Deleted files on remote that weren't in local
# Risk: Could delete important files
```

### New Behavior:
```bash
rsync -avz ...
# Only adds new files or updates existing ones
# Never deletes anything
# Safe for incremental updates
```
