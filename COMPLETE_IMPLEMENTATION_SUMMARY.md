## 📝 **If Registration Shows "Failed" Message:**

Possible causes:
1. **Database constraint** - Username/email already exists
2. **Email sending** - SMTP connection (but registration would still succeed)
3. **Transaction rollback** - Some validation failed

**To diagnose:** Check what specific error message appears on the registration form.
