## 🎯 How the Manual M-Pesa System Works

### User Flow:
1. User selects a package
2. On payment page, sees two options:
   - Automatic M-Pesa (STK Push)
   - Manual M-Pesa Submission (fallback)
3. If automatic fails, user can:
   - Pay manually via M-Pesa
   - Paste confirmation SMS in form
   - Submit for admin review

### Admin Flow:
1. Admin logs in to admin portal
2. Goes to "Manual M-Pesa" section
3. Reviews pending submissions
4. Can approve or reject with notes
5. On approval:
   - Payment marked as completed
   - Subscription automatically activated
   - User can access content
