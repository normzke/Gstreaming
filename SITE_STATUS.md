# BingeTV Site Status Report

## Current Situation

### ✅ What's Working:
- Site is accessible at: https://bingetv.co.ke/public/test.php
- PHP is working correctly (PHP 8.3.25)
- All files are uploaded and synced
- Registration form has username field
- All path issues fixed in code

### ❌ What's NOT Working:
- .htaccess files are causing 500 Internal Server Error
- Clean URLs (without /public/) are not working
- Site cannot be accessed at root URL

### 🔍 Root Cause:
The .htaccess rewrite rules are causing 500 errors on the Bluehost server. This could be due to:
1. Apache configuration doesn't allow certain directives
2. mod_rewrite might have restrictions
3. Syntax incompatibility with server setup

### 📝 What Was Done:
1. ✅ Fixed registration form - added username field
2. ✅ Fixed all user portal paths 
3. ✅ Fixed config.php - disabled error_reporting for production
4. ✅ Fixed config.php - protected session_start()
5. ✅ Uploaded all changes to remote server
6. ❌ .htaccess causing 500 errors - NEEDS FIX

### 🛠️ Next Steps Required:

**Option 1: Contact Bluehost Support**
- Ask them to check why .htaccess rewrite rules cause 500 errors
- Verify mod_rewrite is enabled
- Check Apache error logs for specific .htaccess errors

**Option 2: Use PHP Routing**
- Create index.php in root that handles routing
- No .htaccess needed
- URLs would still be clean

**Option 3: Accept /public/ in URLs**
- Simpler, works immediately
- Update all marketing materials to use /public/
- Less elegant but functional

### 🌐 Current Access:
- Homepage: https://bingetv.co.ke/public/index.php

- Login: https://bingetv.co.ke/public/login.php
- User Portal: https://bingetv.co.ke/user/

All pages should work at these URLs.
